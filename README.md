# Virtual Pet Kennel Application 🐱🐶🐹

A JavaScript application that lets you manage virtual pets in a kennel. Add dogs, cats, and guinea pigs, then interact with them through feeding and playing.

## Features

* Each pet type has unique attributes:
  * Dogs: breed
  * Cats: FIV vaccination status
  * Guinea Pigs: color
* Feed and play with pets to manage their energy levels
* Remove pets from the kennel
* Bulk actions to feed or play with all pets at once
